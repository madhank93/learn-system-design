![mono-mod-micro](../assets/img/mono-mod-micro.png)

A **Monolithic** application is built as a single unified unit, tightly integrated, all components are developed and deployed together. **Modular monolithic** application divided into loosely coupled modules to improve maintainability and scalability. While a **Microservices** architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services.
